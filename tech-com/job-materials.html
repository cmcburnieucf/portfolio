                                The idea behind the first project of ENC3241, "Job Materials", was 
                                to create a professional resume and cover letter for a given job 
                                posting. Through this assignment, students, such as myself, learn 
                                that some forms of technical communication are concerned about 
                                getting an idea across to the audience by understanding what the 
                                same audience is looking for. Being concise and utlizing certain 
                                words and phrases to assist in displaying an idea is more important 
                                than writing more to meet a word count -- a lesson that was not taught 
                                in my earlier writing classes. Below is the given scenario that 
                                revised documents, further below, were based on.

                                        Since I knew how to create a resume, I based the one designed for 
                                        this project on the others I have developed in the past. The job 
                                        posting was for a software engineer intern, so I tailored the resume 
                                        such that the individual viewing the document would know I could be 
                                        qualified to fill in the role. As the original resume had a minor 
                                        issue with formatting in one of the sections, I revised the document 
                                        to fix that. I also decided to further showcase my ability to be a 
                                        software engineer intern by including a new project, the first one 
                                        underneath the "Projects" section. I was not able to include it before 
                                        because the team had barely started on development.
                                        Below is the revised resume.

                                        I had never written a cover letter, as the job postings I applied 
                                        for never requested for such a document. So, to understand how to 
                                        develop a sufficient cover letter, I viewed a variety of examples 
                                        that were meant to by computer science students, such as myself. 
                                        Using these examples as references, I created the original cover 
                                        letter. Unfortunately, the document had errors in conciseness, tone, 
                                        and grammar. To fix these errors, I revised the document based on 
                                        the feedback I was given. The below is the resulting document. While 
                                        not devoid of all the errors, it should correct some of the errors 
                                        that existed in the original.
