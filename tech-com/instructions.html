                            The second project of ENC3241, "Instructions", had students develop 
                            thorough instructions on a software-related technology. Each student 
                            were able to choose their own software for the project. This 
                            assignment had not only showed students how to create professional 
                            instructions but also how to write a document with given 
                            constraints. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this particular scenario, the instructions had to be based on a 
                            software, not any other type of technology. Furthermore, the word 
                            count was limited to one thousand words, allowing students to focus 
                            only on the topic they chose for their instructions. As an effect of 
                            these requirements, students had to have chosen a very specific 
                            topic as to not veer off-topic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For this project, I initially believed that a graphics library would 
                            count as software. It was written by someone else, who developed it 
                            so that it could be used across multiple programming languages, 
                            including Rust, which I used in my instructions. It was also similar 
                            to other types of software, where users had to understand how it 
                            worked in regards to the functions used, the arguments in these 
                            functions, and what steps needed to be done first in order to obtain 
                            the desired result. Since I could not cover every aspect of the 
                            library, I decided to demonstrate a simple example utilizing it. 
                            However, I came across multiple problems that I did not see until 
                            midway of the developing the instructions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first problem was that the reviewers had problems understanding 
                            what the topic was. One assumed it was just code, which was somewhat 
                            incorrect because, while it is true programming was involved, the 
                            instructions were more about using a software for programming. 
                            Another assumed the library was a computer program, which is also 
                            incorrect because a library is not a finished product that is made 
                            to run by itself, it is to give the tools to a real computer program 
                            in order to execute as the developer desires. If I had properly 
                            explained the context of the instructions in an introduction 
                            paragraph, I am sure the readers would have understood it better.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second, and the biggest problem, was the topic I chose. It was 
                            too vague to develop proper instructions to explain all the critical 
                            details and still meet the word count requirement. In the reviews I 
                            received, the need for more detail was a prominent feature. However, 
                            if I did that and tried to explain the creation of program piece by 
                            piece, I would have gone over the word count of one thousand words. 
                            In hindsight, I believe I should have changed the topic so I could 
                            focus on explaining the library rather than the programming itself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the end, I decided that, without recreating the project from 
                            scratch, I could not do much to revise the project to meet the 
                            expectations of the audience. In the below document, I only revised 
                            the formatting and grammatical issues.
